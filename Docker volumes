Docker volumes are used to share the data b/w multiple containers.
When we create a container the volume will be created.
In existing container we can't create volumes.
volume is simply a directory inside our container.
We can share the data to another container inside the volume.
we can't share the data to another container inside the folder.
we can't delete the volume.
We can delete the folder.
Inside the container we have volume inside it we have files and folders. If we lost our container even though we can access our volume.

We can create volumes in 2 ways.
1) command
2)Docker file

docker run -itd --name cont1 -v myvolume ubuntu
docker run -itd --name cont2 --privilege=true --volumes-from contl ubuntu
docker volume  rm volume ID :- To remove volume
docker volume prune :- To delete un-used volumes
docker volume inspect volume-id :- To see comple information about volume
